## multi_sample_SPIM

Selective plane illumination microscopy enables the imaging of many samples in parallel. Such an acquisition scheme produces several terabytes of data / day. To deal with such a huge amount of data, automatic image processing is desirable. Here, we provide the necessary code for the processing of the data coming from a custom SPIM microscope which is however easily adaptable to any other SPIM platform.
