/**
 * <p>Alternative implementation of the smooth coordinate transformation
 * interpolating between a set of control points that are maped exactly on top
 * of each other using landmark based deformation by means of Moving Least
 * Squares as described by \citet{SchaeferAl06}.</p>
 *
 * <p>This implementation stores the control points in double arrays thus
 * being significantly more memory efficient than the object based
 * {@link MovingLeastSquaresTransform}.  The object count is constant and does
 * not depend on the number of control points.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note, the {@link #apply(double[])} and {@link #applyInPlace(double[])}
 * methods are not concurrency safe because they use the same {@link Model}
 * instance to execute the local least squares fit.</p>
